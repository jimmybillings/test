    <md-card>
      <md-card-title>Keep these tips in mind when running your next search:</md-card-title>
      <md-card-content>
        <ul>
          <li>Check Spelling</li>
          <li>Choose Words Carefully</li>
          <li>Broader terms will return more results... more needed here</li>
          <li>
            OR NOT<br/> To exclude words, precede them with NOT. No results containing those words show up in your results.
            For example, if you want to see video about dogs with no mention of poodles, search for dogs NOT poodles. By
            default, search will return results that match all of the words you type in. For example: the search new zealand
            kayaking biking, finds results that contain all of these terms, not those that contain just some of the terms.
            If you are equally interested in two or more alternatives, use OR in capital letters. For example, search for
            new zealand kayaking OR biking. Search will interpret this as: new AND zealand AND kayaking OR biking.
          </li>
          <li>
            Word Order<br/> To search for an exact phrase, just put quotation marks around two or more words. For example,
            search on "Boston College".
